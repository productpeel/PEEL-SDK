### Welcome to the PEEL SDK

PRODUCTPEEL makes the PEEL SDK available to brands and retailers upon request. Our team will help with integration and customization needs that apply. 

It uses JavaScript and React, and can be easily integrated to native mobile apps to enhance your current review system, or as a complete mobile UI for social recommendations/reviews/feedback. You will be able to capture and display interactive user generated videos, images, text in the form of personal recommendations/reviews/feedback. 

This introductory documentation provides a high level overview of the SDK and shows examples. You can contact us at info@productpeel.com to get access to the SDK. 

### Communication with PRODUCTPEEL

On Android and iOS, all communication between your apps and PRODUCTPEEL will be made securely through our Android and iOS libraries. 

We've designed the PEEL SDK to allow you to use your login credentials, and to store Videos and images in your CDN if preferred. Alternatively, you can integrate PRODUCTPEEL's login credentials and CDN. PRODUCTPEEL login supports email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram login. 

Our libraries are broken into three main areas of focus:

### Capturing User Generated Video/Image/Text

Allow users to capture, edit and personalize video, images, and text. You can configure the capture workflow and form as desired.  The customizable elements include:

- Camera view and flash settings
- Single or multiple video/image capture allows a user to post more than one image or video at a time
- Set video thumbnail
- Edit video (15 second videos)
- Add text or stickers to images
- Required/optional fields with text limitations and customizable prompts. Customize field prompts at a product level. For ex: Recomend or Not recommend, 5 Star Ratings, Tell your Story, etc... 
- Product association. Pre-tag products or allow the user to tag the product(s) they post about. 
- Hashtag support
- Share posts publicly, to private networks, or to social media channels (Facebook, PRODUCTPEEL, Twitter, email, text, etc.)

See below for an example capture form on iOS.

### Displaying User Generated Content 

As content is posted, you can specify how you want it displayed in your app and to whom you want it displayed. 

Our system allows you to display videos, images, or text in landscape, portrait, and other custom sizes in a horizontal carousel, a vertical feed, or as a hybrid mix.  We maximize  performance by automatically optimizing image and video sizes.   

Product tags, hashtags, descriptions, recommendations, ratings, comments, actions time, and user information; allow you to easily personalize content for each of your users. You can even create your own customized algorithm. 

As sufficient content is collected, we can help you implement machine learning to constantly optimize what content is displayed to each user. 

See below for an example display method on iOS and Android.

<img src="image1 (3).png" alt="hi" class="inline" height="440" width="280"/> <br>

<img src="image2.png" alt="hi" class="inline" height="440" width="280"/>
