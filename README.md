### Welcome to the PEEL SDK

PRODUCTPEEL makes the PEEL SDK available to brands and retailers upon request. Our team will help with integration and any customization needs that apply. 

It uses JavaScript and React, and can be easily integrated to native apps as a rich mobile UI for capturing and displaying interactive user generated videos, images, recommendations, and reviews. This introductory documentation provides a high level overview of the SDK and shows examples. You can contact us at info@productpeel.com to get access to the SDK.
