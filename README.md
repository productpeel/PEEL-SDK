### Welcome to the PEEL SDK

PRODUCTPEEL makes the PEEL SDK available to brands and retailers upon request. Our team will help with integration and customization needs that apply. 

It uses JavaScript and React, and can be easily integrated to native mobile apps to enhance your current review system, or as a complete mobile UI for social recommendations/reviews/feedback. You will be able to capture and display interactive user generated videos, images, text in the form of personal recommendations/reviews/feedback. 

This introductory documentation provides a high level overview of the SDK and shows examples. You can contact us at info@productpeel.com to get access to the SDK. 

### Communication with PRODUCTPEEL

On Android and iOS, all communication between your apps and PRODUCTPEEL will be made securely through our Android and iOS libraries. 

We've designed the PEEL SDK to allow you to use your login credentials, and to store Videos and images in your CDN if preferred. Alternatively, you can integrate PRODUCTPEEL's login credentials and CDN. PRODUCTPEEL login supports email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram login. 

Our libraries are broken into three main areas of focus:

### Capturing User Generated Video/Image/Text

Allow your users to capture, edit and personalize video, images, and text. You can configure the capture workflow and form as desired.  The customizable elements include:

- Single video/image capture or multiple video/image capture, allowing a user to post more than one image or video
- Setting video thumbnail
- Editing video (videos should be no more than 15 seconds)
- Adding text or stickers to images
- Required or optional fields with customizable prompts. You can customize field prompts at a product level. For ex: Recomend or Not recommend, 5 Star Ratings, Tell your Story, etc... 
- Product association. You can pre-tag products or allow the user to tag the product/service/topic they are posting about. 
- Hashtag support
- Sharing. You can allow your users to share their posts outside your app to other social media channels, email, text, etc...

See below for an example of our SDK implementation on iOS.
